# BullHorn

Bullhorn is new startup with an old idea: create a microblogging platform with a limited number of characters per post - say 140. Yes, just like twitter.

Your task is to create a Dynamic Web Application, a NEW UNIQUE Dynamic Web Application that includes a form allowing a person to enter a new post and a page that lists all the posts made (attractively) in reverse chronological order.

You must use JPA to connect to the database.

Use Bootstrap to make the application attractive.

Take the application you created and add the ability for a user to login. Only logged in users should be able to post, but anyone should be able to view the post stream.

Also add the capability to the post stream page to search all posts for a word.

Now to make your Bullhorn application complete. 
Each user should have their own profile page. 
On the post stream page, the posts should be listed with the poster's name as a link. 
If the link is clicked then the current user (whether logged in or not) should see a profile page for the poster including their name, motto, and join date. 
This page should also have a list of all of their posts, also in reverse chronological order and also searchable.
